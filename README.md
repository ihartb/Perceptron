# Perceptron
Perceptron is a widely used algorithm that teaches computers to label a set of images. 
This project implements a perceptron algorithm from scratch and then uses it to classify partially processed images of faces and digits. 

##Getting Started
###Relevant Files
####1. Images
This folder contains the raw partially processed images and labels for faces and numbers and processed images and labels. 
####2. ProcessData.py
This code processes the raw images and labels from the Images file. Additionally, it pickles (serializes) the processed images and labels to be instantly used during runtime without having to process them ever again. These processed images and labels are saved under ProcessedData in Images. 
####3. Perceptron.py
####4. Interactive.py

###Installation and Running
- Download as zip
- Open in your preferred source code editor that supports Python 
- Run Interactive.py
- Follow the commands in the terminal window

###Dependencies
Numpy (should already be included in the zip) 
If you receive a numpy error, download numpy by typing the following in the terminal using: 
```
pip install numpy
```
